Assignment:
"You work at Uber Analytics. Your bosses have asked you to help them decide whether to increase the wait times of Uber Express from 2 minutes to 5 minutes. They would like to know: would you recommend an increase the wait times from 2 to 5 minutes in additional cities not included in the original Boston synthetic control experiment?"

With the Case Study I was provided, I analyzed the data using Jupyter Notebooks, Tableau, summary statistics, and regressions within my presentation.
